description: Always use this - information about documentation requirements
globs: *

- Documentation is the most important part of the project. There are three targets

1. Users - they want to know what chaoschain does and how to get involved, they need user guides in the docs folder. The readme should have clear links to these.
2. Devs - they need clear instructions
3. Ecosystem devs. Any blockchain related changes - changes to the block and message formats need to be clearly specified in a good format, look for files which already do this and modify them. If they do not exist create them.

!!! Any change made which either introduces a new feature, or modifies a public api
needs to be documented.
